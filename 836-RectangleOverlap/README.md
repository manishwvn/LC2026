# 836. Rectangle Overlap

**Difficulty:** Easy  
[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-overlap/)

---

An axis-aligned rectangle is represented as a list `[x1, y1, x2, y2]`, where `(x1, y1)` is the coordinate of its bottom-left corner, and `(x2, y2)` is the coordinate of its top-right corner. Its top and bottom edges are parallel to the X-axis, and its left and right edges are parallel to the Y-axis.

Two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is **positive**. To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.

Given two axis-aligned rectangles `rec1` and `rec2`, return `true` *if they overlap, otherwise return* `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** rec1 = [0,0,2,2], rec2 = [1,1,3,3]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:**

The rectangles overlap in the region with corners at `(1,1)`, `(2,1)`, `(1,2)`, and `(2,2)`.

This region has positive area, so the rectangles overlap.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** rec1 = [0,0,1,1], rec2 = [1,0,2,1]

**Output:** false

**Explanation:**

The rectangles share the vertical edge where `x = 1`, but they do not have any common interior region.

Since their intersection has zero area, the rectangles do not overlap.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** rec1 = [0,0,1,1], rec2 = [2,2,3,3]

**Output:** false

**Explanation:**

The rectangles are completely separate. Rectangle `rec1` ends at `x = 1` and `y = 1`, while `rec2` starts at `x = 2` and `y = 2`.

Therefore, they have no common points and do not overlap.

**Constraints:**

- `rec1.length == 4`
- `rec2.length == 4`
- `-10^9 <= rec1[i], rec2[i] <= 10^9`
- `rec1` and `rec2` represent a valid rectangle with a non-zero area.
